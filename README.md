## ❓ FAQ & Common Questions

**Q: Is Kick free to use?**
A: Yes, the Kick application is free and open-source. However, if you choose to use a cloud-based AI model (OpenAI or Gemini), you are responsible for any costs associated with your API usage on those platforms. Using a local Ollama model is completely free.

**Q: Is it safe to enable "Deep Control" mode?**
A: Deep Control mode is an extremely powerful feature that gives the AI significant access to your system, including the ability to create or delete files and run commands. While it unlocks incredible automation potential, it carries risks. Only enable this mode if you fully understand and accept responsibility for the actions the AI might take.

**Q: The "Hey Kick" wake word isn't working.**
A: First, ensure the feature is enabled in Kick's settings. Second, check that your microphone is properly connected and that Windows has granted microphone permissions to the application.

**Q: I'm getting an API error when I give a command.**
A: For cloud models (OpenAI/Gemini), this usually means your API key is incorrect or your account has insufficient funds. For local Ollama models, ensure that the Ollama application is running in the background on your computer.
